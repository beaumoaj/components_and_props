## 1. Creating components.

1. Inside the `src` folder, create a new component called `Greeting`.  This component should output the following header:
    ```html
    <h1>This is my message to the world</h1>
    ```
2. Inside `App.js`, find the line of code which says:
    ```html
    <p>Read the instructions to create components</p>
    ```
    and replace it with a call to your new `<Greeting/>` component.  Check that when you view the app, you see the greeting message.
